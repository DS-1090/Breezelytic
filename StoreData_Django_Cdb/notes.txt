//CASSANDRA
install cassandra-driver: 
"Cassandra driver for Python" is a software library that allows Python applications to interact with and access data stored in 
an Apache Cassandra database, enabling you to perform operations like reading, writing, and
 querying data within your Python code by sending commands to the Cassandra server using the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) directly.

//NOTES
Apache cassandra is a nosql, distributed db.
Cassandra deployments handle massive amounts of structured data and provide high availability with no single point of failure. 
To achieve this, Cassandra optimizes queries and arranges its smallest logical units, nodes, in a ring architecture formation.
A Cassandra cluster is a collection of nodes, or Cassandra instances, visualized as a ring.

Given that Apache Cassandra features were architected with horizontal scalability in mind, 
Cassandra can scale to a theoretically unlimited number of nodes in a cluster, and Cassandra 
clusters can be geographically dispersed unlike rdms(they do it to ensure C in CAP(consistency)) and
redis(to ensure low latency),with data exchanged between clusters using multi-datacenter replication.

In Cassandra a node is either a whole physical server, or an allocated portion of a physical server in a virtualized or containerized environment. 
Each node will have requisite processing power (CPUs), memory (RAM), and storage (usually  as SSDs).

These nodes are organized into clusters. Cassandra clusters can be in physical proximity (such as in the same datacenter), or can be distributed over great geographical distances.
 To organize clusters into datacenters and then also across different racks (to ensure high availability), Cassandra uses a snitch monitor.
eventual synchronize between replicated clusters exists.

Within a Cassandra cluster, there is no central primary (or master) node. All nodes in the cluster are peers. 
There are mechanisms, such as the Gossip protocol to determine when the cluster is first started for nodes to discover each other.
This same Gossip mechanism helps to determine when additional nodes are added to the cluster, or when nodes are removed from the cluster

DOCKER COMPOSE USE, NOT NETWORK AS-
It automatically manages networking.
Containers can talk to each other using service names.
It's easy to manage, scale, and deploy.

IN DOCKER NTW, CONTAINERS MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY STARTED, IP ADDRESSES MUST BE CHANGED EVERYTIME
